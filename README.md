# Little Front End project

Deploy: https://front-api-gf.herokuapp.com/

*Note: this is not a finished website.*

This small project had no requirements other than my own needs to aquire some experience and implement some of the concepts i've learned so far. I had a very short timeframe (7 days) and a lot of ideas, so i decided to exclude a few things, not to worry too much about the UI/Web Design itself, and focus mostly on the concepts I wanted to apply and a smooth, bug-free user experience. 
It is based of a small backend project for which i was required to make an API for a supposed dental clinic (you can learn more about it here: https://github.com/GabsFranke/proyectoIntegradorBackend1).

## Goals accomplished
+ In 7 days I learned how to use MUI while coding my first CRUD, also routing and using context for the first time. 
+ I've done a lot of testing based in the userflow and tried to solve as many glitches and errors i could find.
+ The web app can be used in mobiles.
+ App deployment in Heroku platform.

## Dev Comments
Currently the lack of an admin page for Appointments will make user experience a bit weird, since the patients and dentists pages are intended to be used by an admin, and the appointment page is meant for users. 
The thing is that I ran out of time since i'm currently starting a new, much more important - group - project. 
So i had to settle with what I achieved and forcefully left out a few things that would make this basic app look more complete, like a basic login and the admin page for appointments, and maybe a much better landing page.
But I'm quite happy with everything I learned here. This was a great experience.
